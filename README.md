A thin, fast, dependency-free vdom view layer _(MIT Licensed)_

---
### Introduction

domvm is a flexible, pure-js view layer for building high performance web applications.
Like jQuery, it'll happily fit into any existing codebase without introducing new tooling or requiring major architectural changes.

- It's zero-dependency and requires no compilation or tooling; one `<script>` tag is all that's needed.
- It's small: [~6k gz](/dist/README.md), fast: [just 10%](https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts/table.html) slower vs ideal vanilla DOM code. [2x faster SSR](/demos/bench/ssr) vs React v16.
- Its entire, practical API can be mastered in under 1 hour by both, OO graybeards and FRP hipsters. Obvious explicit behavior, debuggable plain JS templates, optional statefulness and interchangable imperative/declarative components.
- It's well-suited for building [simple widgets](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#calendar) and [complex, fault-tolerant applications](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/ThreaditJS).
- Supports down to IE9 with some tiny shims: [Promise](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/promiscuous), [requestAnimationFrame](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671), [matchesSelector](https://gist.github.com/elijahmanor/6452535).

To use domvm you should be comfortable with JavaScript and the DOM; the following code should be fairly self-explanatory:

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;

var HelloView = {
    render: function(vm, data) {
        return el("h1", {style: "color: red;"}, "Hello " + data.name);
    }
};

var data = {name: "Leon"};

domvm.createView(HelloView, data).mount(document.body);
```

### What domvm Is Not

As a view layer, domvm does not include some things you would find in a larger framework.
This gives you the freedom to choose libs you already know or prefer for common tasks.
domvm provides a small, common surface for integration of routers, streams and immutable libs.
Some minimalist libs that work well:

- Routing: [domvm-router](https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm-router), [riot/route](https://github.com/riot/route), [rlite](https://github.com/chrisdavies/rlite), [navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo)
- Ajax/fetch/XHR: [xr](https://github.com/radiosilence/xr), [alite](https://github.com/chrisdavies/alite)
- Streams: [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd), [xstream](https://github.com/staltz/xstream)
- Immutable stores: [Freezer](https://github.com/arqex/freezer), [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)
- Vendor prefixing: [cssprefix](https://github.com/anseki/cssprefix), [prefixfree](https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree)
- CSS-in-JS: [linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), [stylis.js](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js), [j2c](https://github.com/j2css/j2c), [emotion](https://github.com/tkh44/emotion), [oh boy...](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js)

Many [/demos](/demos) are examples of how to use these libs in your apps.

---
### Builds

domvm comes in [several builds](/dist) of increasing size and features. The `nano` build is a good starting point and is sufficient for most cases.

---
### Changelog

Changes between versions are documented in [Releases](https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm/releases).

---
### Installation

**Browser**

```html
<script src="dist/nano/domvm.nano.min.js"></script>
```

**Node**

```js
var domvm = require("domvm");   // the "full" build
```

---
### DEVMODE

If you're new to domvm, the [dev build](/dist/dev/domvm.dev.js) is recommended for development & learning to avoid common mistakes; watch the console for warnings and advice.

There are a couple config options:

- `domvm.DEVMODE.syncRedraw = true` will cause all redraws to be synchronous and non-debounced (useful for unit tests & debugging)
- `domvm.DEVMODE.mutations = false` will disable DOM mutation logging.
- `domvm.DEVMODE.warnings = false` will disable all warnings.
- `domvm.DEVMODE.verbose = false` will suppress the explanations, but still leave the error names & object info.
- `domvm.DEVMODE.UNKEYED_INPUT = false` will disable only these warnings. The full list can be found in [devmode.js](/src/view/addons/devmode.js).

Due to the runtime nature of DEVMODE heuristics, some warnings may be false positives (where the observed behavior is intentional). If you feel an error message can be improved, open an issue!

---
### Templates

Most of your domvm code will consist of templates for creating virtual-dom trees, which in turn are used to render and redraw the DOM.
domvm exposes several factory functions to get this done. Commonly this is called [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript).

For convenience, we'll alias each factory function with a short variable:

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement,
    tx = domvm.defineText,
    cm = domvm.defineComment,
    sv = domvm.defineSvgElement,
    vw = domvm.defineView,
    iv = domvm.injectView,
    ie = domvm.injectElement;
```

Using `defineText` is not required since domvm will convert all numbers and strings into `defineText` vnodes automatically.

Below is a dense reference of most template semantics.

```js
el("p", "Hello")                                            // plain tags
el("textarea[rows=10]#foo.bar.baz", "Hello")                // attr, id & class shorthands
el(".kitty", "Hello")                                       // "div" can be omitted from tags

el("input",  {type: "checkbox",    checked: true})          // boolean attrs
el("input",  {type: "checkbox", ".checked": true})          // set property instead of attr

el("button", {onclick: myFn}, "Hello")                      // event handlers
el("button", {onclick: [myFn, arg1, arg2]}, "Hello")        // parameterized
el("ul",     {onclick: {".item": myFn}}, ...)               // delegated
el("ul",     {onclick: {".item": [myFn, arg1, arg2]}}, ...) // delegated & parameterized

el("p",      {style: "font-size: 10pt;"}, "Hello")          // style can be a string
el("p",      {style: {fontSize: "10pt"}}, "Hello")          // or an object (camelCase only)
el("div",    {style: {width: 35}},        "Hello")          // "px" will be added when needed

el("h1", [                                                  // attrs object is optional
    el("em", "Important!"),
    "foo", 123,                                             // plain values
    ie(myElement),                                          // inject existing DOM nodes
    el("br"),                                               // void tags without content
    "", [], null, undefined, false,                         // these will be auto-removed
    NaN, true, {}, Infinity,                                // these will be coerced to strings
    [                                                       // nested arrays will get flattened
        el(".foo", {class: "bar"}, [                        // short & attr class get merged: .foo.bar
            "Baz",
            el("hr"),
        ])
    ],
])

el("#ui", [
    vw(NavBarView, navbar),                                 // sub-view w/data
    vw(PanelView, panel, "panelA"),                         // sub-view w/data & key
    iv(someOtherView),                                      // injected external ViewModel
])

// special _* props

el("p", {_key: "myParag"}, "Some text")                     // keyed nodes
el("p", {_data: {foo: 123}}, "Some text")                   // per-node data (faster than attr)

el("p", {_ref: "myParag"}, "Some text")                     // named refs (vm.refs.myParag)
el("p", {_ref: "pets.james"}, "Some text")                  // namespaced (vm.refs.pets.james)

el("div", {_flags: ...}, "Some text")                       // optimization flags
```

#### Spread children

`micro`+ builds additionally provide two factories for defining child elements using a `...children` spread rather than an explicit array.

```js
var el = domvm.defineElementSpread,
    sv = domvm.defineSvgElementSpread;

el("ul",
    el("li", 1),
    el("li", 2),
    el("li", 3)
);
```

---
### Views

What React calls "components", domvm calls "views".
A view definition can be a plain object or a named closure (for isolated working scope, internal view state or helper functions).
The closure must return a template-generating `render` function or an object containing the same:

<!--
However, domvm's views can be initialized both imperatively and declaratively prior to being composed within other views or being rendered to the DOM.
This opens the door to much more interesting architectural patterns when needed, without resorting to non-idiomatic framework hacks.
-->

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;

function MyView(vm) {                                       // named view closure
    return function() {                                         // render()
        return el("div", "Hello World!");                           // template
    };
}

function YourView(vm) {
    return {
        render: function() {
            return el("div", "Hello World!");
        }
    };
}

var SomeView = {
    init: function(vm) {
        // ...
    },
    render: function() {
        return el("div", "Hello World!");
    }
};
```

Views can accept external `data` to render (à la React's `props`):

```js
function MyView(vm) {
    return function(vm, data) {
        return el("div", "Hello " + data.firstName + "!");
    };
}
```

`vm` is this views's `ViewModel`; it's the created instance of `MyView` and serves the same purpose as `this` within an ES6 React component.
The `vm` provides the control surface/API to this view and can expose a user-defined API for external view manipulation.

Rendering a view to the DOM is called mounting. To mount a top-level view, we create it from a view definition:

```js
var data = {
    firstName: "Leon"
};

var vm = domvm.createView(MyView, data);

vm.mount(document.body);            // appends into target
```

By default, `.mount(container)` will append the view into the container. Alternatively, to replace an existing placeholder element:

```js
var placeholder = document.getElementById("widget");

vm.mount(placeholder, true);        // replaces placeholder
```

When your data changes, you can request to redraw the view, optionally passing a boolean `sync` flag to force a synchronous redraw.

```js
vm.redraw(sync);
```

If you need to *replace* a view's data (as with immutable structures), you should use `vm.update`, which will also redraw.

```js
vm.update(newData, sync);
```

Of course, you can nest views. This can be done either declaratively or via injection of any already-initialized view:

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement,
    vw = domvm.defineView,
    iv = domvm.injectView;

function ViewA(vm) {
    return function(vm, dataA) {
        return el("div", [
            el("strong", dataA.test),
            vw(ViewB, dataA.dataB),               // implicit/declarative view
            iv(data.viewC),                         // injected explicit view
        ]);
    };
}

function ViewB(vm) {
    return function(vm, dataB) {
        return el("em", dataB.test2);
    };
}

function ViewC(vm) {
    return function(vm, dataC) {
        return el("em", dataC.test3);
    };
}

var dataC = {
    test3: 789,
};

var dataA = {
    test: 123,
    dataB: {
        test2: 456,
    },
    viewC: domvm.createView(ViewC, dataC),
};

var vmA = domvm.createView(ViewA, dataA).mount(document.body);
```

#### Options

`domvm.createView` and `domvm.defineView` have four arguments: `(view, data, key, opts)`.
The fourth `opts` arg can be used to pass in any additional data into the view constructor/init without having to cram it into `data`.
Several reserved options are handled automatically by domvm that correspond to existing `vm.config({...})` options (documented in other sections):

- `init` (same as using `{init:...}` in views defs)
- `diff`
- `hooks`
- `onevent`
- `onemit`

This can simplify sub-view internals when externally-defined opts are passed in, avoiding some boilerplate inside views, eg. `vm.config({hooks: opts.hooks})`.

---
### Parents & Roots

You can access any view's parent view via `vm.parent()` and the great granddaddy of any view hierarchy via `vm.root()` shortcut.
So, logically, to redraw the entire UI tree from any subview, invoke `vm.root().redraw()`.
For traversing the vtree, there's also `vm.body()` which gets the next level of descendant views (not necessarily direct children).
`vnode.body` and `vnode.parent` complete the picture.

---
### Sub-views vs Sub-templates

A core benefit of template composition is code reusability (DRY, component architecture). In domvm composition can be realized using either sub-views or sub-templates, often interchangeably. Sub-templates should generally be preferred over sub-views for the purposes of code reuse, keeping in mind that like sub-views, normal vnodes:

- Can be keyed to prevent undesirable DOM reuse
- Can subscribe to numerous lifecycle hooks
- Can hold data, which can then be accessed from event handlers

Sub-views carry a bit of performance overhead and should be used when the following are needed:

- Large building blocks
- Complex private state
- Numerous specific helper functions
- Isolated redraw (as a perf optimization)
- Synchronized redraw of disjoint views

As an example, the distinction can be discussed in terms of the [calendar demo](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#calendar). Its implementation is a single monolithic view with internal sub-template generating functions. Some may prefer to split up the months into a sub-view called MonthView, which would bring the total view count to 13. Others may be tempted to split each day into a DayView, but this would be a mistake as it would create 504 + 12 + 1 views, each incuring a slight performance hit for no reason.

The general advice is, restrict your views to complex, building-block-level, stateful components and use sub-template generators for readability and DRY purposes; a button should not be a view.

---
### Event Listeners

**Basic** listeners are bound directly and are defined by plain functions. Like vanilla DOM, they receive only the event as an argument. If you need high performance such as `mousemove`, `drag`, `scroll` or other events, use basic listeners.

```js
function filter(e) {
    // ...
}

el("input", {oninput: filter});
```

**Fancy** listeners are executed by a proxy handler and offer additonal features:

- Can handle event delegation
- Can pass through additional arguments
- Will invoke global and vm-level `onevent` callbacks
- Will call `e.preventDefault()` & `e.stopPropagation()` if `false` is returned

They're defined by a hash, an array or a hash of arrays and receive these arguments: `(...args, e, node, vm, data)`.

Listeners defined by a hash are used for event delegation:

```js
function rowClick(e, node, vm, data) {}
function cellClick(e, node, vm, data) {}

el("table", {onclick: {"tr": rowClick, "td": cellClick}}, ...);
```

Arrays can be used to pass additional args to parameterized listeners:

```js
function cellClick(foo, bar, e, node, vm, data) {}

el("td", {onclick: [cellClick, "foo", "bar"]}, "moo");
```

Delegated and parameterized features can be combined:

```js
function cellClick(foo, bar, e, node, vm, data) {}

el("table", {onclick: {"td": [cellClick, "foo", "bar"]}}, ...);
```

View-level and global `onevent` callbacks can be defined to handle **fancy** events:

```js
// global
domvm.config({
    onevent: function(e, node, vm, data, args) {
        // ...
    }
});

// vm-level
vm.config({
    onevent: function(e, node, vm, data, args) {
        // ...
    }
});
```

Notes:

- Animation & transition listeners cannot be attached via `on*` props, such as `animationend`, `animationiteration`, `animationstart`, `transitionend`. To bind these events use a node-level `willInsert` [Lifecycle Hook](#lifecycle-hooks).
- `onevent`'s args always represent the origin of the event in the vtree

---
### Autoredraw

Is calling `vm.redraw()` everywhere a nuisance to you?

There's an easy way to implement autoredraw yourself via a global or vm-level `onevent` which fires after all **fancy** [event listeners](#event-listeners).
The [onevent demo](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#onevent) demonstrates a basic full app autoredraw:

```js
domvm.config({
    onevent: function(e, node, vm, data, args) {
        vm.root().redraw();
    }
});
```

You can get as creative as you want, including adding your own semantics to prevent redraw on a case-by-case basis by setting and checking for `e.redraw = false`.
Or maybe having a Promise piggyback on `e.redraw = new Promise(...)` that will resolve upon deep data being fetched.
You can maybe implement filtering by event type so that a flood of `mousemove` events, doesnt result in a redraw flood. Etc..

---
### Refs & Data

Like React, it's possible to access the live DOM from event listeners, etc via `refs`. In addition, domvm's refs can be namespaced:

```js
function View(vm) {
    function sayPet(e) {
        var vnode = vm.refs.pets.fluffy;
        alert(fluffy.el.value);
    }

    return function() {
        return el("form", [
            el("button", {onclick: sayPet}, "Say Pet!"),
            el("input", {_ref: "pets.fluffy"}),
        ]);
    };
}
```

VNodes can hold arbitrary data, which obviates the need for slow `data-*` attributes and keeps your DOM clean:

```js
function View(vm) {
    function clickMe(e, node) {
        console.log(node.data.myVal);
    }

    return function() {
        return el("form", [
            el("button", {onclick: [clickMe], _data: {myVal: 123}}, "Click!"),
        ]);
    };
}
```

Notes:

`vm.state` & `vm.api` are userspace-reserved and initialized to `null`.
You may use them to expose view state or view methods as you see fit without fear of collisions with internal domvm properties & methods (present or future).

---
### Keys & DOM Recycling

Like React [and any dom-reusing lib worth its salt], domvm sometimes needs keys to assure you of deterministic DOM recycling - ensuring similar sibling DOM elements are not reused in unpredictable ways during mutation.
In contrast to other libs, keys in domvm are more flexible and often already implicit.

- Both vnodes and views may be keyed: `el('div', {_key: "a"})`, `vw(MyView, {...}, "a")`
- Keys do not need to be strings; they can be numbers, objects or functions
- Not all siblings need to be keyed - just those you need determinism for
- Attrs and special attrs that should be unique anyhow will establish keys:
  - `_key` (explicit)
  - `_ref` (must be unique within a view)
  - `id` (should already be unique per document)
  - `name` or `name`+`value` for radios and checkboxes (should already be unique per form)

---
### Hello World++

**Try it:** http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#stepper1

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;                       // element VNode creator

function StepperView(vm, stepper) {                 // view closure (called once during init)
    function add(num) {
        stepper.value += num;
        vm.redraw();
    }

    function set(e) {
        stepper.value = +e.target.value;
    }

    return function() {                             // template renderer (called on each redraw)
        return el("#stepper", [
            el("button", {onclick: [add, -1]}, "-"),
            el("input[type=number]", {value: stepper.value, oninput: set}),
            el("button", {onclick: [add, +1]}, "+"),
        ]);
    };
}

var stepper = {                                     // some external model/data/state
    value: 1
};

var vm = domvm.createView(StepperView, stepper);    // create ViewModel, passing model

vm.mount(document.body);                            // mount into document
```

The above example is simple and decoupled. It provides a UI to modify our stepper object which itself needs no awareness of any visual representation.
But what if we want to modify the stepper using an API and still have the UI reflect these changes. For this we need to add some coupling.
One way to accomplish this is to beef up our stepper with an API and give it awareness of its view(s) which it will redraw.
The end result is a lightly-coupled domain model that:

1. Holds state, as needed.
2. Exposes an API that can be used programmatically and is UI-consistent.
3. Exposes view(s) which utilize the API and can be composed within other views.

It is *this* fully capable, view-augmented domain model that domvm's author considers a truely reusable "component".

**Try it:** http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#stepper2

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;

function Stepper() {
    this.value = 1;

    this.add = function(num) {
        this.value += num;
        this.view.redraw();
    };

    this.set = function(num) {
        this.value = +num;
        this.view.redraw();
    };

    this.view = domvm.createView(StepperView, this);
}

function StepperView(vm, stepper) {
    function add(val) {
        stepper.add(val);
    }

    function set(e) {
        stepper.set(e.target.value);
    }

    return function() {
        return el("#stepper", [
            el("button", {onclick: [add, -1]}, "-"),
            el("input[type=number]", {value: stepper.value, oninput: set}),
            el("button", {onclick: [add, +1]}, "+"),
        ]);
    };
}

var stepper = new Stepper();

stepper.view.mount(document.body);

// now let's use the stepper's API to increment
var i = 0;
var it = setInterval(function() {
    stepper.add(1);

    if (i++ == 20)
        clearInterval(it);
}, 250);

### Emit System

Emit is similar to DOM events, but works explicitly within the vdom tree and is user-triggerd.
Calling `vm.emit(evName, ...args)` on a view will trigger an event that bubbles up through the view hierarchy.
When an emit listener is matched, it is invoked and the bubbling stops.
Like fancy events, the `vm` and `data` args reflect the originating view of the event.

```js
// listen
vm.config({
    onemit: {
        myEvent: function(arg1, arg2, vm, data) {
            // ... do stuff
        }
    }
});

// trigger
vm.emit("myEvent", arg1, arg2);
```

There is also a global emit listener which fires for all emit events.

```js
domvm.config({
    onemit: {
        myEvent: function(arg1, arg2, vm, data) {
            // ... do stuff
        }
    }
});
```

### Lifecycle Hooks

**Demo:** [lifecycle-hooks](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#lifecycle-hooks) different hooks animate in/out with different colors.

#### Node-level

Usage: `el("div", {_key: "...", _hooks: {...}}, "Hello")`

- `will`/`didInsert(newNode)` - initial insert
- `will`/`didRecycle(oldNode, newNode)` - reuse & patch
- `will`/`didReinsert(newNode)` - detach & move
- `will`/`didRemove(oldNode)`

While not required, it is strongly advised that your hook-handling vnodes are [uniquely keyed](#keys--dom-recycling) as shown above, to ensure deterministic DOM recycling and hook invocation.

#### View-level

Usage: `vm.config({hooks: {willMount: ...}})` or `return {render: ..., hooks: {willMount: ...}}`

- `willUpdate(vm, data)` - before views's data is replaced
- `will`/`didRedraw(vm, data)`
- `will`/`didMount(vm, data)` - dom insertion
- `will`/`didUnmount(vm, data)` - dom removal

Notes:

- `did*` hooks fire after a forced DOM repaint.
- `willRemove` & `willUnmount` hooks can return a Promise to delay the removal/unmounting allowing you to CSS transition, etc.

---
### Third-Party Integration

Several facilities exist to interoperate with third-party libraries.

#### Non-interference

First, domvm will not touch attrs that are not specified or managed in your templates.
In addition, elements not created by domvm will be ignored by the reconciler, as long as their ancestors continue to remain in the DOM.
However, the position of any inserted third-party DOM element amongst its siblings cannot be guaranteed.

#### will/didInsert Hooks

You can use normal DOM methods to insert elements into elements managed by domvm by using [will/didInsert hooks](#lifecycle-hooks).
See the [Embed Tweets](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#embed-tweets) demo.

#### injectElement

`domvm.injectElement(elem)` allows you to insert any already-created third-party element into a template, deterministically manage its position and fire lifecycle hooks.

#### innerHTML

You can set the innerHTML of an element created by domvm using a normal `.`-prefixed property attribute:

```js
el("div", {".innerHTML": "<p>Foo</p>"});
```

However, it's **strongly recommended** for security reasons to use `domvm.injectElement()` after parsing the html string via the browser's native [DOMParser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser).

---
### Extending ViewModel & VNode

If needed, you may extend some of domvm's internal class prototypes in your app to add helper methods, etc.
The following are available:

- `domvm.ViewModel.prototype`
- `domvm.VNode.prototype`

---
### Isomorphism & SSR

Like React's `renderToString`, domvm can generate html and then hydrate it on the client.
In `server` & `full` builds, `vm.html()` can generate html.
In `client` & `full` builds, `vm.attach(target)` should be used to hydrate the rendered DOM.

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;

function View() {
    function sayHi(e) {
        alert("Hi!");
    }

    return function(vm, data) {
        return el("body", {onclick: sayHi}, "Hello " + data.name);
    }
}

var data = {name: "Leon"};

// return this generated <body>Hello Leon</body> from the server
var html = domvm.createView(View, data).html();

// then hydrate on the client to bind event handlers, etc.
var vm = domvm.createView(View, data).attach(document.body);
```

---
### Streams

domvm supports streams to automatically update template content and will manage subscriptions for the life of the view.  To use streams you must first configure domvm with the stream signature relevant to the stream library you are using.  For example, the correct configuration for using [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd) is:

```
domvm.config({
  stream: {
    is:		s => flyd.isStream(s),
    val:	s => s(),
    sub:	(s, fn) => flyd.on(fn, s),
    unsub:	s => s.end(true),
  }
});
```

After configuration, you can pass a stream as the element body (not as an array):

```
const title = flyd.stream('Start');

# ...

defineElement('h1', title)
```

...or an attribute value:

```
const disabled = flyd.stream(true);

# ...

defineElement('button', {disabled: disabled}, 'OK');
```

One limitation of passing streams as the element body is that it is incompatible with `defineElementSpread`.

The [demo playground](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/) has a comprehensive [example](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#streams).

### Optimizations

Before you continue...

- Recognize that domvm with no optimizations is able to rebuild and diff a full vtree and reconcile a DOM of 3,000 nodes in < 1.5ms. See [0% dbmonster bench](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/bench/dbmonster/).
- Make sure you've read and understood [Sub-views vs Sub-templates](#sub-views-vs-sub-templates).
- Ensure you're not manually caching & reusing old vnodes or holding references to them in your app code. They're meant to be discarded by the GC; let them go.
- Profile your code to be certain that domvm is the bottleneck and not something else in your app. e.g. [Issue #173](https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm/issues/173).
  - When using the DEVMODE build, are the logged DOM operations close to what you expect?
  - Are you rendering an enormous DOM that's already difficult for browsers to deal with? Run `document.querySelectorAll("*").length` in the devtools console. Live node counts over 10,000 should be evaluated for refactoring.
  - Are you calling `vm.redraw()` from unthrottled event listeners such as `mousemove`, `scroll`, `resize`, `drag`, `touchmove`?
  - Are you using `requestAnimationFrame()` where appropriate?
  - Are you using event delegation where appropriate to avoid binding thousands of event listeners?
  - Are you properly using CSS3 transforms, transitions and animation to do effects and animations rather than calling `vm.redraw()` at 60fps?
  - Do thousands of nodes or views have lifecycle hooks?
- Finally, understand that optimizations can only reduce the work needed to regenerate the vtree, diff and reconcile the DOM; the performed DOM operations will always be identical and near-optimal. In the vast majority of cases, the lowest-hanging fruit will be in the above advice.

Still here? You must be a glutton for punishment, hell-bent on rendering enormous grids or tabular data ;) Very well, then...

#### Isolated Redraw

Let's start with the obvious.
Do you need to redraw everything or just a sub-view?
`vm.redraw()` lets you to redraw only specific views.

#### Flatten Nested Arrays

While domvm will flatten nested arrays in your templates, you may get a small boost by doing it yourself via `Array.concat()` before returning your templates from `render()`.

#### Old VTree Reuse

If a view is static or is known to not have changed since the last redraw, `render()` can return the existing old vnode to short-circuit the vtree regeneration, diffing and dom reconciliation.

```js
function View(vm) {
    return function(vm) {
        if (noChanges)
            return vm.node;
        else
            return el("div", "Hello World");
    };
}
```

The mechanism for determining if changes may exist is up to you, including caching old data within the closure and doing diffing on each redraw. Speaking of diffing...

#### View Change Assessment

Similar to React's `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `vm.config({diff:...})` is able to short-circuit redraw calls.
It provides a caching layer that does shallow comparison before every `render()` call and may return an array or object to shallow-compare for changes.

```js
function View(vm) {
    vm.config({
        diff: function(vm, data) {
            return [data.foo.bar, data.baz];
        }
    });

    return function(vm, data) {
        return el("div", {class: data.baz}, "Hello World, " + data.foo.bar);
    };
}
```

`diff` may also return a plain value that's the result of your own DIY comparison, but is most useful for static views where no complex diff is required at all and a simple `===` will suffice.

With a plain-object view, it looks like this:

```js
var StaticView = {
    diff: function(vm, data) {
        return 0;
    },
    render: function(vm, data) {},
};
```

Notes:

If you intend to do a simple diff of an object by its identity, then it's preferable to return it wrapped in an array to avoid domvm also diffing all of its enumerable keys when `oldObj !== newObj`.
This is a micro-optimization and will not affect the resulting behavior.
You can see the simple diffing logic [here](https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm/blob/e7299cc42077ae1750ae8de1f753042570ce63f9/src/view/ViewModel.js#L214-L220).
Also, see [Issue #148](https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm/issues/148).

#### VNode Patching

VNodes can be patched on an individual basis, and this can be done without having to patch the children, too.
This makes mutating attributes, classes and styles much faster when the children have no changes.

```js
var vDiv = el("div", {class: "foo", style: "color: red;"}, [
    el("div", "Mooo")
]);

vDiv.patch({class: "bar", style: "color: blue;"});
```

DOM patching can also be done via a full vnode rebuild:

```js
function makeDiv(klass) {
    return el("div", {class: klass, style: "color: red;"}, [
        el("div", "Mooo")
    ]);
}

var vDiv = makeDiv("foo");

vDiv.patch(makeDiv("bar"));
```

`vnode.patch(vnode|attrs, doRepaint)` can be called with a `doRepaint = true` arg to force a DOM update.
This is typically useful in cases when a CSS transition must start from a new state and should not be batched with any followup `patch()` calls.
You can see this used in the [lifecycle-hooks demo](http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#lifecycle-hooks).

#### Fixed Structures

Let's say you have a bench like dbmonster in this repo.
It's a huge grid that has a fixed structure. No elements are ever inserted, removed or reordered.
In fact, the only mutations that ever happen are `textContent` of the cells and patching of attrs like `class`, and `style`.

There's a lot of work that domvm's DOM reconciler can avoid doing here, but you have to tell it that the structure of the DOM will not change.
This is accomplished with a `domvm.FIXED_BODY` vnode flag on all nodes whose `body` will never change in shallow structure.

```js
var Table = {
    render: function() {
        return el("table", {_flags: domvm.FIXED_BODY}, [
            el("tr", {_flags: domvm.FIXED_BODY}, [
                el("td", {_flags: domvm.FIXED_BODY}, "Hello"),
                el("td", {_flags: domvm.FIXED_BODY}, "World"),
            ])
        ]);
    }
};
```

This is rather tedious, so there's an easier way to get it done. The fourth argument to `defineElement()` is `flags`, so we create an additional element factory and use it normally:

```js
function fel(tag, arg1, arg2) {
    return domvm.defineElement(tag, arg1, arg2, domvm.FIXED_BODY);
}

var Table = {
    render: function() {
        return fel("table", [
            fel("tr", [
                fel("td", "Hello"),
                fel("td", "World"),
            ])
        ]);
    }
};
```

#### Fully-Keyed Lists

In domvm, the term "list", implies that child elements are shallow-homogenous (the same views or elements with the same DOM tags).
domvm does not require that child arrays are fully-keyed, but if they *are*, you can slightly simplify domvm's job of matching up the old vtree by *only* testing keys.
This is done by setting the `domvm.KEYED_LIST` vnode flag on the parent.

#### Lazy Lists

Lazy lists allow for old vtree reuse in the absence of changes at the vnode level without having to refactor into more expensive views that return existing vnodes.
This mostly saves on memory allocations. Lazy lists may be created for both, keyed and non-keyed lists.
To these lists, you will need:

- A list-item generating function, which you should have anyways as the callback passed to a `Array.map` iterator.
- For keyed lists, a key-generating function that allows for matching up proper items in the old vtree.
- A `diff` function which allows a lazy list to determine if an item has changed and needs a new vnode generated or can have its vnode reused.
- Create a `domvm.lazyList()` iterator/generator using the above.
- Set the appropriate flags on the list parent (`domvm.KEYED_LIST`, `domvm.LAZY_LIST`) and each list item (`{_key: ...}`)

While a bit involved, the resulting code is quite terse and not as daunting as it sounds: http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/demos/playground/#lazy-list
